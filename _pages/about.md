HELLO,

I am a master student in the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) program, at Language Technologies Institute (LTI), Carnegie Mellon University. I am working with Professor Jamie Callan. 

My research interests fall in Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Currently I'm working on creating a shallow, entity-oriented knowledge base from large-scale corpus to improve adhoc search. Previously, at UCLA Scalable Analytics Institute, I worked on a text mining project which aims to learn representation of medical entities from case reports.

I completed my undergraduate study in Wuhan University, majoring in Information Management and Information System.
