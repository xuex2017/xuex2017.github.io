Education
======
* M.S. in Intelligent Information Systems, Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University Expected Dec. 2019
* B.S. in Information Management and Information System, Wuhan University Sept. 2014 - June 2018
* Exchange Student, School of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles July 2017 - Sept. 2017

Experience
======
## Deep Learning Intern
* Intel Software and Services Group (SSG)
* Shanghai, China May 2018 - July 2018
  *  Contributed to the release of Analytics-Zoo 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 by building deep learning applications including image classification, text classification, fraud detection
  * Developed a Scala utility package for pre-processing natural language data and built a web service application for text classification using deep learning inference model (CNN, LSTM, etc.)
  * Built model application for image classification task on dogs-vs-cats dataset by fine-tuning Inception-V1 model, which improved accuracy from 90% to 99.2% after transfer learning
  * Refactored high-level APIs to speed up development for multi-threaded tasks, such as inference with pre-trained models
  
## Research Intern
* Scalable Analytics Institute, University of California, Los Angeles
* Los Angeles, CA July 2017 - Sept. 2017
  * Performed independent research on entity representation learning for the development of a medical case report query system, supervised by Prof. Yizhou Sun and Prof. Wei Wang
  * Constructed graphs for annotated domain-specific entities in clinical case reports and implemented an unsupervised graph embedding method with node2vec for the graph representation of case reports
  * Visualized result by projecting the 128-dimensional embedding of 2491 entities into 3D space using PCA
  * Evaluated result by calculating cosine similarity between medical terms and corresponding abbreviations, which
outperformed Google's word2vec pre-trained word embedding
