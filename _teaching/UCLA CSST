* Performed independent research on entity representation learning for the development of a medical case report query system, supervised by Prof. Yizhou Sun and Prof. Wei Wang
* Constructed graphs for annotated domain-specific entities in clinical case reports and implemented an unsupervised graph embedding method with node2vec for the graph representation of case reports
* Visualized result by projecting the 128-dimensional embedding of 2491 entities into 3D space using PCA
* Evaluated result by calculating cosine similarity between medical terms and corresponding abbreviations, which
outperformed Google's word2vec pre-trained word embedding
